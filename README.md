# 🏗 Architecture

TalentFlow Backend follows a layered architecture inspired by production-ready backend systems.

The application separates business logic, data access, API endpoints, and database models into independent layers to improve scalability, maintainability, and testability.

```
                Client
                   │
            HTTP Request
                   │
            FastAPI Router
                   │
              Service Layer
                   │
          Repository Layer
                   │
        SQLAlchemy Async ORM
                   │
             PostgreSQL
```

## Architecture Principles

The project follows several modern backend engineering principles:

- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Injection
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer Pattern
- Asynchronous Programming
- Data Validation using Pydantic
- Database Abstraction
- Clean Project Structure

# 🔄 Request Flow

Every request follows the same lifecycle.

```
Client

↓

API Router

↓

Business Service

↓

Repository

↓

Database

↓

Repository

↓

Service

↓

JSON Response
```

This approach keeps the application modular, testable, and easy to extend.

---

# 🧩 Why this Architecture?

Instead of placing all business logic directly inside API routes, TalentFlow separates responsibilities into dedicated layers.

This design provides several advantages:

- Easier maintenance
- Better code readability
- Reusable business logic
- Cleaner API endpoints
- Simplified testing
- Better scalability
- Easier collaboration in larger development teams

The same architecture is commonly used in enterprise backend applications built with FastAPI and other modern Python frameworks.
---

# 🗄 Database Design

TalentFlow uses PostgreSQL as the primary relational database.

The database schema has been designed to ensure data consistency, scalability, and maintainability while supporting future feature expansion.

The project uses **SQLAlchemy Async ORM** together with **Alembic** for schema migration and version control.

---

# Core Entities

The current database contains the following main entities.

| Entity | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User | Stores authentication and account information |
| Role | Defines application permissions |
| Company | Company profile information |
| Candidate | Candidate profile |
| Resume | Candidate uploaded resumes |
| Job | Job postings |
| Application | Candidate job applications |

---

# Relationships

The project uses relational database modeling with SQLAlchemy ORM.

Examples include:

- One Company → Many Jobs
- One Candidate → Many Applications
- One User → One Role
- One Candidate → Multiple Resume Files

The database design follows normalization principles to reduce redundancy while maintaining performance.

---

# 🔐 Authentication Flow

TalentFlow implements secure JWT authentication.

Authentication process

```

User Login

↓

Verify Credentials

↓

Generate JWT Token

↓

Return Access Token

↓

Authenticated Requests

↓

Protected Endpoints

```

Security features

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT Access Tokens
- OAuth2 Password Flow
- Protected Routes
- Role Validation

---

# 👥 Authorization (RBAC)

TalentFlow uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Each authenticated user is assigned a role.

Current roles

- Administrator
- Recruiter
- Candidate

Each role has its own permissions and API access.

This architecture makes it easy to introduce new roles without modifying existing business logic.

---

# 📁 Resume Upload

TalentFlow supports secure resume management.

Features

- Resume Upload
- File Validation
- Safe File Naming
- File Storage
- Resume Download

Uploaded files are managed separately from business logic to simplify future migration to cloud storage providers such as AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

---

# 📡 REST API

The backend exposes RESTful APIs following common HTTP standards.

Example endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| POST | /auth/login | User Login |
| POST | /auth/register | Register User |
| GET | /users/me | Current User |
| GET | /jobs | List Jobs |
| POST | /jobs | Create Job |
| POST | /upload | Upload Resume |

Interactive API documentation is available through Swagger UI.

```

http://localhost:8000/docs

```

---

# ⚙ Environment Configuration

The application supports multiple environments using environment variables.

Configuration includes

- Database Connection
- JWT Secret Key
- Token Expiration
- Upload Directory
- Docker Configuration

Sensitive values are never stored inside the source code.

Environment variables are managed through

```

.env

```

and

```

.env.example

```

to simplify deployment.
